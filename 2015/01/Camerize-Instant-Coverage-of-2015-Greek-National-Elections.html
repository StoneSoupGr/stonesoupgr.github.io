It is a crowdsourced video production tool that allows live video streaming from multiple mobile devices. All the feeds go to the Camerize server and are edited live into a single output. </p>

<p>We figured we had to set ourselves a deadline, as deadlines help to get things done and decided to cover the National Elections in Greece. We gathered a team of journalists and camera operators and covered events in Athens live as they happened. The content was broadcasted at the Camerize Youtube Channel and the website of Popaganda.gr.</p>

<p>Crowdsourced live video production at this scale has not been done before. Thanks to our team and volunteers, it was a very successful experiment and an opportunity to learn about a new way of producing content. The day of the #2015 elections was the day that for the first we took Camerize out from our safe development environment into the open, and a very special day for Greece. We are proud to say &quot;We were there!&quot;. We will be working hard so all our participants can say the same of Camerize some day! </p>
